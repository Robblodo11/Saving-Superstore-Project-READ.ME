#### Part 2: Advertising
* Optimal Advertising Combinations
  * Identified the 3 best combinations of states and month of the year to advertise in by creating a table that looks at the average profit for each state, by month of the year
* Return on Ad Spend Analysis
  * Analysis conducted to determine average profit per unit sold vs return on ad spend ratio to justify advertising expenditure. Ad spend ratio is roughly 1/5th of profits.

#### Conclusion
* Among the dimensions, I determined that Shipping mode alone is one of the biggest centers of profit, with standard shipping class having an overall profit of $164,089. When looking at shipping mode and product category, we see a profit of $83,0129 in technology products shipped with the standard shipping class.
* The biggest profit Losses can be seen when looking at Region & Sub-category, and Shipping mode & Region. Region & sub-category we can see the biggest profit loss of $11,025 with tables. When looking at the Shipping Mode & Region, we can see the biggest profit loss of $1,762 with same day shipping in the southern region.
* The top 3 products I would recommend to stop selling would be the Cubify CubeX 3D printer, Triple head printer which has a profit loss of $3,840 The Cubify CubeX 3D printer, Double head printer with a profit loss of $2,960, and the Cisco TelePresence System Ex90 Videoconferencing unit with a profit loss of $1,811.
* The Top 3 sub-categories of products I recommend to focus on is Copiers, Phones, and Accessories with profits of $55,618, $44,516, and $41,937 respectively.
* The Bottom 3 sub-categories I recommend to stop selling are Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies with prfoit losses of $17,725, $3,473, and $1,189 respectively.
* The top 3 states with the highest average profit are Vermont in November with $596.1, Rhode Island in December with a profit of $250, and Indiana in October with a profit of $643.1. We should spend roughly  1/5th of the profits for each month on advertising. For Vermont in November we should spend $119.22 in advertising. For Rhode Island in December we should spend $50 on advertising, and lastly in Indiana we should spend $128.62 on advertising.
* Utah, Montana, and California customers have the highest return rates out of all of the United States, with return rates of 0.01826, 0.01786, and 0.01656 respectively
* When looking at the Average profit agsint the average rate of return, the furniture category has a very high rate of return while also having the lowest average profit vs's Office supplies and technology. I recommend the superstore to stop selling furniture.
